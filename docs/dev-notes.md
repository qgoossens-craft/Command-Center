# Command Center Plugin - Development Notes

## Current Status
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Phase**: Starting Phase 1 - Foundation & Basic Structure
- **State**: Sample plugin template, needs complete refactoring

## Architecture Overview
The plugin will be structured as follows:
- `main.ts` - Plugin entry point and lifecycle management
- `views/` - Custom views (HomepageView)
- `widgets/` - Individual widget components
- `settings/` - Settings management
- `types/` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `styles/` - CSS modules

## Phase 1 Plan

### Current State Analysis
- Sample plugin structure exists with basic template code
- Dependencies are installed
- Build system (esbuild) is configured
- Need to rename from "Sample Plugin" to "Command Center"

### Implementation Plan for Phase 1

1. **Update Plugin Metadata**
   - Update manifest.json with correct plugin information
   - Update package.json with proper naming
   - Clean up sample code

2. **Create Project Structure**
   ```
   Command-Center/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── main.ts
   │   ├── types/
   │   │   └── settings.ts
   │   ├── views/
   │   │   └── HomepageView.ts
   │   ├── settings/
   │   │   └── SettingsTab.ts
   │   └── constants.ts
   ├── styles/
   │   ├── main.css
   │   └── homepage.css
   ```

3. **Implement Basic Plugin Lifecycle**
   - Plugin class with proper naming (CommandCenterPlugin)
   - Settings interface for homepage configuration
   - Basic view registration
   - Ribbon icon and command palette entry

4. **Create Homepage View Foundation**
   - Custom ItemView for the homepage
   - Basic container structure
   - CSS foundation with Obsidian theming variables

5. **Settings Infrastructure**
   - Settings interface with basic options
   - Settings tab implementation
   - Persistence of settings

### Technical Decisions
- Use TypeScript strict mode for better type safety
- Separate concerns into modules (max 500 lines per file)
- Use Obsidian's CSS variables for consistent theming
- Implement proper cleanup in onunload()

## Known Issues & Considerations
- Mobile compatibility needs to be tested
- Performance monitoring needed for view rendering
- Need to ensure compatibility with different Obsidian themes

## Next Steps After Phase 1
- Phase 2: Core UI Components (header, layout system)
- Phase 2 will build upon the foundation created in Phase 1
